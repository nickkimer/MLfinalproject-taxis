# MLfinalproject-taxis

## Motivation

There is an interesting question (several questions actually...) to be asked in the service industry that tends to be defined for restaurants and bars but not Taxis - what should the tip be?

1. As a driver for FHV (for-hire vehicles), are certain customers worth more than others in terms of tip percentage?
2. Can we predict the tip percentage? 
3. What factors contribute most to larger tips?
